# This is an example VW log configuration file. Save
# this file to ~/.vw_logconf to adjust the VW log
# settings, even if the program is already running.
#
# The following integers are associated with the
# log levels throughout the Vision Workbench. Use
# these in the log rules below.
#
#    ErrorMessage = 0
#    WarningMessage = 10
#    InfoMessage = 20
#    DebugMessage = 30
#    VerboseDebugMessage = 40
#
# You can create a new log file or adjust the settings
# for the console log:
#
#   logfile <filename>
#       - or -
#   logfile console
#
# Once you have created a logfile (or selected the
# console), you can add log rules using the following
# syntax. (Note that you can use wildcard characters
# ’*’ to catch all log_levels for a given log_namespace,
# or vice versa.)
#
# <log_level> <log_namespace>
#
# Example: For the console log, turn on InfoMessage
# logging for the thread sub-system and log every
# message from the cache sub-system.
